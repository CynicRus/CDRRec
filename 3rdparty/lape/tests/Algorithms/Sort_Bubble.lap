  BubbleSort:
    Every time it loops through the array, it moves the largest item it can find to the back of unsorted area of the array,
    it repeats this until all items have been sorted. It moves the largest item to the back until it finds a larger item on
    the way with which it continues until it's moving the largest item in the array.
}

procedure BubbleSort(var Arr: array of Int32);
var
  CurIndex, TmpIndex, Hi: Int32;
begin
  Hi := High(Arr);
  for CurIndex := 0 to Hi do
    for TmpIndex := 1 to Hi - CurIndex do
      if Arr[TmpIndex - 1] > Arr[TmpIndex] then
        Swap(Arr[TmpIndex - 1], Arr[TmpIndex]);
end;

var
  TIA: array of Int32;
begin
  TIA := [1, 6, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1, 2, 7, 1];
  BubbleSort(TIA);
  WriteLn(TIA);
end.
